# XML Processor Middleware Application - Functional Specification

## 1. Overview
The XML Processor Middleware Application is a web-based system designed to process and store XML documents containing Advanced Shipping Notice (ASN) data. The application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading XML files, validates them against predefined schemas, and stores the processed data in a relational database.

## 2. User Interface Requirements

### 2.1 Frontend Interface
- Modern, responsive web interface built with React
- Navigation bar with Upload, History, Transform, and UX sections
- File upload component for XML documents
- Status display for upload and processing operations
- Error messaging system for invalid uploads or processing issues
- Data visualization of processed ASN records

### 2.2 History View
- Table display of all processed files
- File name, processing date, and status information
- Status indicators (Success, Error, Warning)
- Number of records processed per file
- Error messages for failed processing attempts
- Auto-refresh capability (every 30 seconds)

### 2.3 Transform Page
- Split-panel interface showing XML elements and database fields
- Dynamic XSD structure loading and refresh capability
- Mapping creation between XML elements and database fields
- Configuration saving functionality
- Visual feedback for mapping operations
- Real-time validation of mapping rules

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 XML File Processing
- Support for various XML file formats
- Validation against XSD schemas
- Handling of different date formats
- Processing of both header and line item data
- Support for different XML structures and naming conventions
- Prevention of duplicate entries

### 3.2 Data Management
- Storage of ASN header information
- Storage of ASN line items
- Prevention of duplicate entries
- Data validation and error handling
- Support for various field types (dates, numbers, text)
- Transaction management

### 3.3 Mapping Configuration
- Dynamic XSD structure loading
- Real-time XSD refresh capability
- XML to database field mapping
- Mapping rule management (create, delete)
- Configuration persistence
- Validation of mapping rules

## 4. Business Rules

### 4.1 Data Validation Rules
- XML files must conform to specified XSD schemas
- Required fields must be present and valid

### 4.2 Processing Rules
- Duplicate ASN entries should be prevented
- All line items must be associated with a header
- Data type conversions must maintain accuracy
- Error handling must be comprehensive
- Mapping rules must be applied consistently

## 5. Error Handling

### 5.1 User Feedback
- Clear error messages for invalid file uploads
- Processing status updates
- Validation failure notifications
- Database operation status feedback
- Mapping configuration error notifications

### 5.2 System Errors
- XML parsing errors
- Schema validation failures
- Database operation failures
- Network connectivity issues
- Mapping rule validation errors

## 6. Performance Requirements
- File upload size limits: up to 10MB
- Processing time: < 30 seconds per file
- Concurrent user support: up to 50 users
- Response time: < 2 seconds for UI operations
- History view refresh: every 30 seconds

## 7. Security Requirements
